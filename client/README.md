## About Flutter

Flutter is Google's SDK for crafting beautiful, fast user experiences for
mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing
code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and
open source.

We think Flutter will help you create beautiful, fast apps, with a productive,
extensible and open development model, whether you're targeting iOS or Android,
web, Windows, macOS, Linux or embedding it as the UI toolkit for a platform of
your choice.
